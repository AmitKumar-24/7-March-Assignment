    "\n",
    "The median is the middle value in the dataset, such that half of the values are greater than or equal to the median, and the other half are less than or equal to the median. The median is less sensitive to outliers than the mean and is a better measure of central tendency for skewed distributions.\n",

    "In practice, the choice of the measure of central tendency depends on the characteristics of the dataset and the research question.
